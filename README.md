# Discorder

Discorder is an interactive command line discord client.

Discord server: https://discord.gg/0vYlUK2XBKlmxGrX

Join for updates, to suggest stuff, complain about stuff, or just talk about stuff

## Installing/Running

#### Latest Alpha

Try the latest alpha version here: https://github.com/jonas747/discorder/releases

#### compiling from repo

You need go and git installed, and your gopath set up

run this command: `go get -u github.com/jonas747/discorder/cmd/discorder`

(-u: to force an update if you have a older version)

After that there should be a built executable in your $GOPATH/bin folder

## Features

Note: Discorder still lacks a lot of features, so i wouldn't consider using it as a full replacement yet

 - Light on resource usage
     + This depends on how many tabs you have open and how many channels you're listening in on offcourse
     + Maybe not so much in this early development stage where everything is still getting set up and organised, but will be a focus later on
